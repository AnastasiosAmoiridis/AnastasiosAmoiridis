## A typical day in the office! ☕🤖
```javascript
class Engineer {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "Anastasios Amoiridis";
    this.nickname = "Amir";
    this.philosophy = "Clarity over cleverness.";
    this.sanity = 100; 
  }

  code() { 
    console.log("💻 Bugs… Gonna fix them all! Current sanity:", this.sanity);
    this.sanity -= 10; // coding decreases sanity
  }

  drinkCoffee() {
    console.log("☕ One more wouldn't hurt… sanity restored a little! Current sanity:", this.sanity);
    this.sanity += 10; // coffee restores some sanity
  }

  considerLife() {
    console.log("😅 Considering life choices…");
  }

  dailyRoutine() {
    console.log(`Starting daily routine… (${this.philosophy})`);

    while (this.sanity > 0) {
      this.code();
      this.considerLife();
      this.drinkCoffee();
    }

    console.log("…but sanity is always precarious ☕💀");
  }
}
